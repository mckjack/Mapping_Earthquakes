# Mapping Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to analyze earthquake data by getting JSON data from sources on the web and using our knowledge of Javascript visualize this data on a webpage. We were able to visualize it using maps by using the Mapbox API to show the data on a map of the world. Lastly, we did some styling to better visualize the data. 
## For Users
To view the interactive webpage the user must go to https://www.mapbox.com/ to retrieve their own API key then paste and rename the file
